The "twisted connector" shown is a mechanical component used to connect elements at different directions or planes in various applications such as mechanical engineering, construction, electrical engineering, the automotive industry, and architectural structures. It is typically made of strong materials like steel or aluminum, allowing movement or rotation between connected parts. The connector is installed using bolts or screws through the holes at both ends.
